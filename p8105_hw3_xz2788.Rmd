```

# Problem 1

Load dataset and package

```{r load_dataset_package}
library(p8105.datasets)
library(tidyverse)
```

Look at the data first

```{r overview_data, eval=FALSE}
str(brfss_smart2010)
head(brfss_smart2010)
tail(brfss_smart2010)
View(brfss_smart2010)
```

Tidy the data

```{r tidy_data}
brfss_smart2010_tidy = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010) %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" |  response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor")
```

Convert the "response" variable into a factor

```{r convert_to_factor}
brfss_smart2010_tidy$response = factor(brfss_smart2010_tidy$response, 
                      levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
```

## which states were observed at 7 locations
